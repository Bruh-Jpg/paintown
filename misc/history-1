History of paintown: volume 1

  I used to go to my grandfather's house for breakfast in the winter. He was too old and usually drunk to actually make breakfast but since I was allowed to go there without my family I learned how to operate the kitchen and sneak a few shots of tequila every once in a while. I spent 5 winters making burnt pancakes and learning about the world through a drunken stupor before my grandfather passed away. I wasn't even told about his passing before the last time I went there. Here I am, a 12 year old kid and my parents don't even tell me that my grandfather wasn't going to be there. At least he didn't drink all the booze, maybe that was his parting gift to me. Thank grandpa.
  After that I dropped out of junior high school and joined the military. You might wonder why the military would allow a 14 year old to enlist but in fact they didn't. I became friends with one of the enlisted men through an online forum that discussed popcorn. He was the landlord of a commune on the base he worked at and he offered to let me stay there, since I had no other place to go. I lived in his place for a few years slowly learning the ways of the military through osmosis. When I was 17 I procured a fake id with a fake name and signed myself up to serve my country. Actually I couldn't care less about my country, I just noticed how much fun it was to get paid to work out and potentially kill people. The army being what it was, they didn't check any of my credentials and soon enough I was on my way to becoming a five star general, or at least mess officer.
  The enlisted men don't get much respect, especially from the officers, so after cheating on enough tests I had achieved the rank of second lieutenant. Having then been given more power and responsibilty than I knew what to do with I went AWOL in the hopes of settling down in the wilderness of Canada. The army went looking for me, of course, but I knew the guys that were going to do the searching so I bribed them to do a bad job. Not like they were going to do a good job, anyway, they were all dumb as rocks.
  I made my way past the border by pretending to be a homeless person. The Canadian border patrol apparently doesn't care about homeless people wandering into the country or maybe they were just very nice people. Either way when I saw a patrol person I yelled as many curse words as possible at him before he tipped his hat and said "Good day". Thouroughly confused, I made my way into some town and stole a few loafs of bread and matches. I found an uninhabited cave in the forests a few miles from town and started to make my home. I used my army training to start a fire using the bread and matches and settled down for the night. When I woke up 2 days later I noticed a huge bear poking its nose into my cave. My only recourse was to again yell curse words but I must have gone insane by then because the bear said to me "Dude, you can't live in here. Are you homeless?". After a few more curse words for good measure I realized it wasn't a talking bear at all. It was just some kids playing hide and seek in the backyard of their house. I apologized for sleeping in their backyard to which they said they were going to call the police. I informed them that I was a five-star general which they didn't believe at first but after rattling off a few random facts about the army they came around to believe in my new found rank. I told them that I needed practice doing "army things" and some of that consisted of taking a shower and playing video games. They agreed and let me into their house. I played all the games they had including Tekken, Bubble Bobble, PaRappa the Rapper, and others. All the games were terrible, except for PaRappa the Rapper, so I decided that I would use my military training and quick wit to create a new game. I demanded that the children teach me how to create something I could play on a computer and they said they didn't have a computer. I took their bread and matches and left their place.
  Then one day while loitering around a tv in a window shop I saw an ad for a school that promised to teach everything one needed to know about making games called Devry. I took down the number by scratching it into my arm and ran to the nearest telephone booth so that I could apply over the phone. When the woman on the other end asked me my name I burst into the story of my life and how I needed to learn about computers or my wife would leave me. That must have done the trick because she told me to print out their application and mail it in with the requisite $500. I said thank you, walked into a random store to use a printer, printed my application, and mailed it in. I left out the $500 dollars but I said that I had all sorts of degrees from fancy places like Harvard and Yale so I thought that would impress them enough to let me in for free. I used the address of the store who's printer I used so I had to secretly steal their mail for a week before I got a reply from Devry. The answer was "yes"! I had bullied my way into an esteemed instituion where I could learn how to make video games.
  I hitchiked a dozen or so rides until I found myself outside the Devry campus and prepared myself for my new learning experience. I wasn't any good at learning, but I was pretty good at cheating and got A's in most classes there. Some of the classes didn't seem very helpful at the outset such as "Finding your inner mario" and "More cheese please!" but I wasn't paying for the classes so I didn't care. I ended up being validictorian of my class and was supposed to make some sort of speech at the graduation so I rambled on for 45 minutes about how computers are the future and that love and peace are the true path to happiness. I think a dead goat could have been validictorian of that place because the crowd thought my speech was brilliant. I made the thing up on the spot for crying out loud! Anyway, with my new diploma in hand I started applying to some game development companies.
  I got a job as a junior programmer at some low rent video game studio. They were making a game about watching tv, of all things, which bored the living bajeesus out of me. Rather than waste my time on the game I buddied up with one of the lead programmers so that I could actually learn how to make games. Before that company fired me for doing absolutely no work, I learned how to write a program that printed "Hello world" to the screen. After some fiddling with it I was even able to make it print "Hello world" twice! I knew I was well on my way to becoming a five-star general of the video game world.
  Later, some italian guys around the neighborhood offered me a job protecting small business by breaking their windows unless they paid us money. I didn't understand what I was protecting but it was easy money either way. A few years of that gave me enough money to buy a condo, an internet connection, and a computer. At first I bought the same computer that we used at Devry, at 286 with an EGA monitor, but after reading some posts on usenet I discovered that my 286 was very old and I should have bought a 2ghz dual core something or other. With my new computer and lots of time on my hands I taught myself the art of programming and posting funny pictures of cats on the internet. Having mastered programming, I started on my quest to create the ultimate video game: Paintown.
