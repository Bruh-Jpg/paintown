First build paintown in nacl mode (read doc/nacl)

$ ln -s ../../../paintown paintown-32.nexe
# or name it paintown-64.nexe if you are on a 64-bit machine
$ ./httpd.py
# navigate your browser to http://localhost:5103/paintown.html

You should see the word 'Paintown!' next to a button labeled 'Run'. Wait for
a second while the nacl application is loaded and then click 'Run'.
