* How to build with Google's Android SDK:
*  This assumes you are on linux and the current version which is revision 11 (you can modify it for windows as necessary)
*  You can go to http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html and download the appropriate bins for your OS
*  
*  - To work with the SDK you need to have Java JDK installed: http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/index.jsp

  1. Setup the Android environment:
      - wget http://dl.google.com/android/android-sdk_r11-linux_x86.tgz
      - tar xzvf android-sdk_r11-linux_x86.tgz
      - cd android-sdk-linux_x86/tools
      - ./android
      -
