get the mingw cross compiler:
  g++-mingw-w64
  gcc-mingw-w64

check out build-environments/mingw

symlink build-environments/mingw to /opt/mingw

Build paintown

$ export mingwx=1
$ make

To run it symlink all the allegro dlls from /opt/mingw/bin to the current directory.
Probably you also need libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll and libstdc++-6.dll

  /usr/lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.6/libgcc_s_sjlj-1.dll
  /usr/lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/4.6/libstdc++-6.dll
