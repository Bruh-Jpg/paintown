* How to build for Google's Native Client:
*  This assumes you are on linux (you can modify it for windows as necessary)
*  You can go to http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html and download the appropriate bin for your OS
*  
*  - To install naclports you need a version of the 'patch' program at least 2.6.1 - grab it here: ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/patch

  1. Download and setup the Native Client toolchain:
      - wget http://commondatastorage.googleapis.com/nativeclient-mirror/nacl/nacl_sdk/naclsdk_linux.tgz
      - tar xvf naclsdk_linux.tgz
      - mv native_client_sdk_* /opt/nacl_sdk
      - export PATH=/opt/nacl_sdk/toolchain/linux_x86/bin:"$PATH"
  
  2. Setup chrome depot tools and nacl ports. Building the ports can take a while.
      - export NACL_SDK_ROOT=/opt/nacl_sdk
      - svn co http://src.chromium.org/svn/trunk/tools/depot_tools
      - mv depot_tools /opt/nacl_sdk
      - export PATH=/opt/nacl_sdk/depot_tools:"$PATH"
      - mkdir /opt/nacl_sdk/naclports
      - cd /opt/nacl_sdk/naclports
      - gclient config http://naclports.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/src
      - gclient sync
      - cd src/packages
      - ./nacl-install-all.sh (if you get an error before it starts look at the note at the top regarding 2.6)
                - *NOTE If you get errors building expat, fontconfig and/or cairo then it won't build the 64-bit libs so you need to do it manually:
                - ./nacl-install-all-bitsize.sh 64
                - Likewise if you wanted to do 32-bit just in case do: ./nacl-install-all-bitsize.sh 32
      
  
  3. Set the build type environment variable to 'nacl' and build paintown by default it will detect whether your system is 32-bit or 64-bit
      - export SDL=1
      - export nacl=1
      - cd /path/to/paintown
      - make
      
  4. (* Optional) If you need to build for a specific architecture then you can override the architecture by setting one of the two items below
      - For 32-bit override: export nacl_32=1
      - For 64-bit override: export nacl_64=1

  5. Test it with the stuff in src/test/nacl
